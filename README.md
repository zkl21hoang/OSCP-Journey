# OSCP-Journey
1. TryHackMe: 6 Learning Paths + 2 Advent Of Cyber
(2.5 months - If you haven't had any experience before, you should focus on the learning materials of both theory and labs, It prepares you enough to start HackTheBox journey)

2. Portswigger: 197 Practical Labs
(1.5 months - Server-side topics and Client-Side topics are enough, Advanced topics are for the preparation of OSWE)

3. HackTheBox: 98 Machines (TjNull NetSecFocus List)
(2 months - Almost of them are in TjNull NetSecFocus List, you would learn a great amount of new things while practicing with those machines)

4. Vulnhub: 45 Machines (TjNull NetSecFocus List)
(1 month - Easier than HackTheBox machines but you can learn the "Try Harder" methodology with a couple of new things for your penetration testing methodology during this journey)

5. PWK Labs: 31 Machines
(2 weeks - Of course you should do PWK Labs before taking the exam :D I still have the remaining time of lab subscription and will complete all of them even I passed)

6. Proving Ground (Practice): 55 Machines
(3 weeks - you SHOULD complete all the machines [Community Rate: Intermediate + Hard] before taking the exam, its my last learning path before knocking off this beast)
